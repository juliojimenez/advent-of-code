# Contributing to Advent of Code

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Use GPG to Sign Your Commits

Only pull requests that have been signed will be accepted. For more information on setting up a GPG key for your Github account see the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/managing-commit-signature-verification).

## Contributing Code

All code contributions are made via pull requests. We actively welcome your pull requests and review regularly. We practice the mainline development method.

- Fork the repo and create your branch from main.
- Update the documentation, if applicable.
- Create a pull request.
- Ensure status checks pass.

## Licensing Notes

Any contributions you make will be under the Apache-2.0 License. When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same Apache-2.0 License that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
